## 2. Motivation
During the university lives, students are struggling to manage their studying activities, including keeping track of task progress and organizing upcoming assignment deadlines. Traditional calendars or note-taking apps are more like writing down deadline on the paper and do not have features such as integrated study timers, task-based progress tracking, reminder intervals, or meaningful productivity feedback. 

We set out to build a lightweight, academically focused productivity application that helps students reach their academic milestones smoothly and with enthusiasm. Our motivation comes from our own challenges in balancing university coursework, deadlines, and study routines.

## 3. Objectives

### Functional Objectives
- Allow users to create, view, and manage daily study sessions.
- Provide a built-in study timer with start, pause, and reset controls.
- Support short quick-test reminder intervals.
- Support task management, including creation, completion toggling, linking to assignments, and deletion.
- Enable assignment creation with due dates and automatic progress calculation.
- Provide optional periodic study reminders.
- Offer motivational features like badges, study tips, and break suggestions.
- XP and level system with animated XP toast and persisted level progress.
- Level card showing current level and XP and a progress bar.
- Ensure all data persists reliably across app restarts.
- Study tips engourage users to finish the work.

### Technical Objectives
### Technical Objectives
- Implement the app using React Native, Expo (SDK 54), and TypeScript (5.9).
- Use Expo Router for file-based routing and file-based navigation patterns.
- Use React Context + `useReducer` for global state management and predictable updates.
- Persist app state using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` via a small wrapper in `services/storage.ts`.
- Implement a theme system (light / dark / auto) via a ThemeProvider and responsive tokens.
- Integrate `expo-notifications` for scheduling local reminders and handling permission flows.
- Integrate with external APIs via `services/api.ts` for study tips.

## 10. Lessons Learned and Concluding Remarks

Throughout this project, our team gained experiences in building mobile applications with React Native and Expo. Followings are the aspects we have learnt:
- Organize and manage global state using the Context API  with useReducer.
- Structure navigation in a clean, scalable way with Expo Router.
- Store data reliably through AsyncStorage, supported by a custom wrapper that we built.
- Handle asynchronous features like timers, reminders, and notifications.
- Work through permission handling and subtle differences between mobile platforms.

The Study Planner App has successfully meet the motivation at the start. It not only offer students a reminder of their course work, but also make study an interesting and enjoyable parts of lives.  Through the process, we have developed experiences in mobile UI/UX design, state management, asynchronous programming, and collaborative development.
